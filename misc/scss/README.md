This facilities making the compressed bulma.min.css and cssgg.min.css files, install all dependencies using:
```
yarn install
```

And then use:
```
yarn bulma && yarn cssgg
```

This compiles bulma.scss and cssgg.scss to a css file and helps lowering the size of the css that will be sent to the user.
